# OFDM-and-MMSE
OFDM banseband and MMSE/LMMSE for channel estimation

The power of each signals is balenced (IFFT/FFT) amoung the OFDM transmitter and receiver.

MMSE_Uniform_PDP.m refers to the paper of OFDM Channel Estimation by Singular Value Decomposition.

MMSE_Channel_Tap_Comb_Pilot.m and MMSE_Channel_Tap_Block_Pilot.m refer to the book MIMO-OFDM WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS WITH MATLAB.
